# SQLite Migration Checklist

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Updated database.php to use SQLite instead of MySQL
- [x] Added compatibility layer for MySQL-specific code
- [x] Created SQLite schema (`db/schema.sqlite.sql`)
- [x] Created database initialization script (`init_sqlite_db.php`)
- [x] Successfully initialized empty SQLite database
- [x] Created deployment documentation for GCP
- [x] Added README for SQLite branch

## Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Test application with SQLite database
- [ ] Update specific models with SQLite-specific queries if needed
- [ ] Create data migration script to transfer data from MySQL to SQLite (if needed)
- [ ] Implement database backup and maintenance scripts in production
- [ ] Test deployment on GCP
- [ ] Update all documentation with SQLite-specific instructions

## Known Potential Issues
1. Some SQL queries may still contain MySQL-specific syntax
2. Some models may need updates for SQLite compatibility
3. The compatibility layer may not handle all edge cases
4. Performance tuning may be needed for production use

## Next Steps
1. Run application tests with SQLite database
2. Fix any compatibility issues in models
3. Test deployment on local environment
4. Prepare for GCP deployment

## Migration Benefits
- Simplified deployment process
- Reduced infrastructure requirements
- No need for separate database server
- Easier local development
- Reduced hosting costs on GCP
